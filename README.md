Copy pictures from an iPhone recursively and skip already-copied images:
```
MediaDeviceCopier.exe download-files -n "Apple iPhone" -s "Internal Storage" -t "D:\MyPictureFolder" -se -r
```

Copy all pictures from an iPhone recursively, skip already copied images and only copy folders beginning with 2025:
```
MediaDeviceCopier.exe download-files -n "Apple iPhone" -s "Internal Storage" -t D:\MyPictureFolder" -se -r -p "^2025.*"
```

Move (download then delete from device) all videos after archiving:
```
MediaDeviceCopier.exe download-files -n "Apple iPhone" -s "Internal Storage\DCIM\100APPLE" -t "D:\Archive" -se -r --move
```

## Tips

- Always use `list-devices` first to get the correct device name.
- Use double quotes around folder names if they contain spaces.
- Regular expressions in `-p` follow standard .NET regex syntax.
